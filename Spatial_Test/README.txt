The test contains 8 questions assessing your spatial reasoining skills. the final version contains 6 questions
Each questions displays a 3D image and 4 2D image options. 
One of the 2D images cannot be reproduced by rotation of the 3D image and is the correct option.
The 2D options are displayed in a 2 by 2 grid in the final version. this minimizes the amount of scrolling required to go through the options and creates a more friendly user interface.
The code is saved into a python file, which is imported into the notebook use_this_to_run_spatial_test. the user will not have to go through the code that runs the test.
Only the code that imports the python file needs to be run to do the test
